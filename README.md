Flash Crash Generation and Prevention: Understanding, Modeling, and Mitigating Market Disruptions

Working With Algorithmic Trading Company Algostox

The research focused on investigating potential causes and mechanisms behind market crashes and employing a computational approach to understanding these phenomena.

The objective of this project is to investigate the conditions necessary to generate a flash crash in the equities market, similar to the one that occurred on May 6, 2010, and other similar events. The project aims to determine various ways and strategies with which such events can be artificially generated and derive recommendations for flash crash prevention mechanisms based on the findings. To achieve the goal, we built a microstructural model that reflects the observed behaviours and studied its numerical solutions using Python. Based on the findings, we derive recommendations for flash crash prevention mechanisms.
